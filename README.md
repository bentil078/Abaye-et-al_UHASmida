# UHASmida

UHAS-MIDA is an open-source software tool that calculates the red blood cell (RBC) concentration and blood volume during malaria in children determined using a stable isotope of chromium (53Cr as the label) during gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in selective ion monitoring (GC/MS-SIM) analysis. A key component involves the determination of the compositions of the most abundant naturally occuring isotopes of chromium (50Cr, 52Cr, 53Cr), and converting the proportions into a 3x3 matrix and its inverse. The inverse is then used to calculate the ‘corrected’ MS ion abundances. UHAS-MIDA supports the user to efficiently determine RBC concentration and fluid volume loss
